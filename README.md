# Campus-Network
In this project, we defined a simulation of campus networks based on wireless networking. The network is divided into two sets: one for the campus area and the other for the hostel area. The major aim of this project is to show the wireless connectivity that is used in universities to make the network efficient and mobile at the same time.
